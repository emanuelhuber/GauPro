# GauProMod
R functions for Gaussian process (GP) modelling. The core functions are coded 
in C++ and based on the EIGEN library (through RcppEigen)

- [x] GP conditioned to data
- [x] Space-time Gaussian process
- [x] GP with monomial mean functions
- [x] GP conditioned to derivative observations
- [ ] add function for hyper-parameter estimation
- [ ] add other covariance models

This is an ongoing project.
