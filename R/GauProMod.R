#' GauProMod: A package for simulating conditional and unconditional Gaussian
#' Process.
#'
#' The GauProMod package provides R functions for Gaussian process (GP) modelling. 
#' The core functions are coded in C++ and based on the EIGEN library.
#' 
#' @section Features:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Conditional GP simulation
#'   \item Space-time GP
#'   \item GP with monomial mean functions
#'   \item GP conditioned to derivative observations
#' }
